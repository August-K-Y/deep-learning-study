You can add a layer to a model using the model's add() method. For example, a simple model with a single hidden layer might look like this:\n",

This chain of passing output to the next layer continues until the last layer, which is the output of the model. We can see that the output has dimension 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "The activation \"layers\" in Keras are equivalent to specifying an activation function in the Dense layers, for example\"\n",

    "\n",
    "Once we have our model built, we need to compile it before it can be run. Compiling the Keras model calls the backend (tensorflow, theano, etc.) and binds the optimizer, loss function, and other parameters required before the model can be run on any input data. We'll specify the loss function to be `categorical_crossentropy` which can be used when there are only two classes, and specify `adam` as the optimizer (which is a reasonable default when speed is a priority). And finally, we can specify what metrics we want to evaluate the model with. Here we'll use accuracy.\n",

    "```python\n",
    "model.summary()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The model is trained with the `fit()` method, through the following command that specifies the number of training epochs and the message level (how much information we want displayed on the screen during training).\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "model.fit(X, y, nb_epoch=1000, verbose=0)\n",

    "5. Run the model for 50 epochs.\n",
    "\n",
    "This should give you an accuracy of 50%. That's ok, but certainly not great. Out of 4 input points, we're correctly classifying only 2 of them. Let's try to change some parameters around to improve. For example, you can increase the number of epochs. You'll pass this quiz if you get 75% accuracy. Can you reach 100%?\n",
    "\n",
    "To get started, review the Keras documentation about models and layers. The Keras example of a [Multi-Layer Perceptron](https://github.com/keras-team/keras/blob/master/examples/mnist_mlp.py) network is similar to what you need to do here. Use that as a guide, but keep in mind that there will be a number of differences."
